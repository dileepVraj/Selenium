    /*What is static dropdown?*/

    /*A static dropdown in html referer to a dropdown menu that contains a fixed set of options that do not change
    * based on user input or any external factors.
    *
    * In other the options in static dropdown are hardcoded into html code of the page and cannot be modified dynamically.
    *
    * To create a static dropdown in html we have to use <select> tag along with <option> tags to specify each individual
    * option.
    * For example:
    *
    * <select>
        <option value="option1">Java</option>
        <option value="option2">Dot net</option>
        <option value="option3">Python</option>
        <option value="option4">Java script</option>
      </select>
      *
      * In this example the select tag creates the dropdown menu, while each <option> tag defines a single option within
      * the dropdown.
      *
      * The value attribute of each <option> tag specifies the value that will be submitted to the server when the form
      * containing the dropdown is submitted, while the text between opening and closing <option> tags specifies the text
      * that will be displayed to the user in the dropdown.
        *
