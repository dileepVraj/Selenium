     * What are frames in html page:
     *
     * In HTML a frame is a separate rectangular region of a web page that can display different HTML documents simultaneously
     * Frames are used to divide screen into different sections, each displaying different HTML document.
     * Frames are commonly used in past to create layouts such as displaying navigation menu in one frame while the content
     * of page is displaying in another page.
     *
     * Frames are defined using the HTML <frame> tag or its variants such as <frameset></frameset> and <iframe></iframe>
     * <frameset> </frameset> tag defines the layout of the frames on the webpage, while the <frame> tag is used to
     * specify the content that should be displayed in each frame.
     *
     * However, frames are now considered outdated and are no longer widely used due to a variety of issues, such as problems
     * with bookmarking, search engine optimization, and accessibility.
     * Modern web design typically uses CSS layouts and responsive design techniques to achieve similar effects without
     * relying on frames.

    /**
     * What are iframe tag in html doc?
     * An iframe (short for inline frame) is an HTML element that allows you to embed another HTML document within the current
     * document.
     * The content of the embedded document is displayed in a rectangular frame within the current document.
     * iframes are often used to display content from other websites such as google-maps, YouTube, with in a webpage.
     *
     * The <iframe> </iframe> tag is used to create the <iframe></iframe>. The tag has several attributes that can be
     * used to customize the Iframes appearance and behaviour, such as height and width of the frame, the source of the
     * embedded document, and whether to display scrollbars with in the iframe.
     *
     * Here is an example of an iframe that displays YouTube video.
     * <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.YouYube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_HERE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe
     *
     * In this example, the width and height attributes specify the size of the iframe, and the src attribute specifies the URL
     * of embedded YouTube video.
     * The frame border attribute sets whether to display a border around the iframe, and the allowfullscreen attribute
     * specifies whether the video should be allowed to play in fullscreen mode.
