     * What is apache POI?
     */

    /*Apache POI is a java API for working with Microsoft Office documents such as Excel, Word, and powerPoint.
    * It provides a set of java classes to read and write data from and to Excel files.
    *
    * In automation testing with Selenium Java, Apache POI is used to read data from Excel files and use it in test
    * Scripts.
    * Test data can be stored in Excel sheets, and Apache POI allows Selenium scripts to access this data easily.
    * It can also be used to write data to Excel files, allowing test results to be stored in a separate Excel file for
    * easy analysis.
    *
    * For example, let's say you have a test script that needs input data from an Excel sheet into a web form.
    * You can use apache POI to read the data from the Excel sheet and store it in variables that can be used in the test
    * script.
    * This allows you to easily modify the test data without having to change the test script.
    * Similarly, if you want to write test results to an Excel sheet, you can use Apache POI to create a new Excel
    * sheet, you can use Apache POI to create a new Excel file and write the results to it.
    *
    * Overall apache POI makes it easy to work with Excel files in selenium java automation testing and provides a
    * convenient way to store and retrieve test data.*/
