     * X path concept is used in every UI automation like with web applications, mobile applications and windows applications.
     *
     * Xpath get so much importance because of it has properties to locate a webelement dynamically, if we don't have any
     * standard locators like name, id, visible text, class name etc... to locate and webelement then we can locate that
     * webelement using xpath by taking reference of previous or succeeding element's.
     *
     * It can locate elements in dynamic way rather than identifying elements in static way.
     *
     * what is a static way of identifying webelements?
     *
     * static way of identifying elements is identifying elements using standard locators like name , id , class name,
     * visible text etc...
     *
     * we can use xpath in every tool that is designed for UI automation.

    /**
     * What is xpath?
     *
     * basically we know that xpath as dynamic locator to locate webelements in webpage or web application, but basically
     * xpath is a query language xpath(xml path language) for selecting nodes from an XML document or for finding
     * elements in HTML web page.
     *
     * In XML document we can use user defined tags like person, dog, name, house etc...
     * But in HTML language we have predefined tags and we cant use user defined tags in HTML language.
     *
     * so the point is we can use xpath to locate elements in xml document where user defined tags are allowed so why
     * we cannot find or locate elements in html document using xpath.
     *
     * xpath is defined by w3c(world wide web) consortium.
