    /**
     * In selenium actions class is used to perform advanced user interactions with web elements, such as drag and drop,
     * double-clicking, right-clicking, and hovering.
     *
     * The Actions class provides a way to chain multiple actions together to perform complex user interactions.
     * For example, to perform a drag and drop operation, you can first move the source element, click and hold on it,
     * move to the target element, and then release the mouse button.
     * Here is an example code snippet:
     *
     * WebElement element1 = driver.findElement(By.id("element_id));
     * WebElement element2 = driver.findElement(By.id("element_id));
     *
     * Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
     * actions.dragAndDrop(element1,element2);
     * actions.perform;
     *
     * In the example above the actions class instance is created with webdriver instance. Then the drag and drop
     * method is called on the actions object, passing in the source element(element1) adn the target element
     * (element2) finally the perform method is called to execute the actions.
     *
     * Note that the 'ActionsChains' class can be sued in combination with other selenium classes and methods, such as
     * 'WebDriverWait' to perform more complex user interactions and automate web testing.
