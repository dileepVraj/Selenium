    /**
     * The perform() method is a very important method in the Actions class in Selenium.
     * This method is used to execute the actions that are defined using the various methods in the Actions class.
     *
     * In Selenium, most of the methods in the Actions class return an instance of the Actions class itself.
     * This is done to enable method chaining, which means that multiple actions can be performed in a single line of code.
     * However, until the perform() method is called, none of the actions are actually executed.
     *
     * For example, let's consider the following code:
     *
     * Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
     * WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("element-id"));
     * actions.moveToElement(element).click().build().perform();
     *
     * In this code, we first create an instance of the Actions class and find an element on the page using its ID.
     * We then use the moveToElement() method to move the mouse to the center of the element,
     * followed by the click() method to click on the element.
     *
     * However, until we call the perform() method, none of these actions will actually be executed.
     * The build() method is used to build the composite action, which is a collection of individual actions,
     * and then the perform() method is called to execute the composite action.
     *
     * Therefore, the perform() method is essential for executing the actions that are defined using the various methods
     * in the Actions class.
     *Without calling the perform() method, the actions will not be executed, and the desired user interaction will not occur.
     *
