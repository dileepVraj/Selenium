     * What is testNG:
     *
     * TestNG is a testing framework for java programming language.
     * This is developed by 'Cedric beust'.
     * The idea comes to develop TestNG is to include some advanced features they are not in Junit and Nunit frameworks
     * used for testing(unit testing) the applications.
     * Nunit is used with .net programming language, where Junit is used with the java programming language.
     *
     * The full form of TestNG is ' test next generation'.
     *
     * TestNG is not only a unit testing framework, testNG is a testing framework that can be used with unit testing,
     * system testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing.

    /**
     * Advantages of TestNG:
     *
     * 1. Annotations(more compared to Junit).
     * 2. Running tests in parallel mode using thread pools with various policies available.
     * 3. Test your code is multi thread safe.
     * 4. Flexible test configuration.
     * 5. Support for data driven testing (with @DataProvider).
     * 6. Support for parameters.
     * 7. Powerful execution model (no more test suite).
     * 8. Supported by variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven etc...)
     * 9. Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies)
     * 10. Dependent methods for application server testing.

    /**
     * Execution order of test methods in testNG:
     *
     * The default executing order of the testNG methods is based on the alphabetical order of the method name.
     * Assume we have 2 test methods in a class which are named as 'googleTest' and 'faceBook' test now while executing
     * all the test methods at a time the facebook method will be executed first because the f letter comes first in
     * alphabets than letter g.
