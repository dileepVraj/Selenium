    /**
     * In this class we are going to know What are extent reports and why we use them.
     *
     * First of all we have to know that reporting is very important thing in any test automation.
     *
     * If we developed a good framework without reporting then it is a scrap, we need to consider some factors while
     * creating any framework, those are
     * 1. Object repository
     * 2. Test data
     * 3. Framework configuration
     * 4. Code reuse ability
     * 5. Reporting.
     *
     * The above 5 components or aspects we have to consider as important things while creating a framework.
     *
     * There are other components in a framework but these are very fundamental components that should be in the framework.
     *
     * Object repository: how we are storing our page object elements, like HTML elements information.
     *
     * Test Data : How we are storing our data that is used in our test cases, storing in XML, JSON, Database or Excel file.
     *
     * Configuration: how easily we can configure our application information into the framework to run the test.
     *
     * Code reuse-ability: How we are using our code in the test.
     *
     * Reporting: this is heart of the framework, this is important thing we need to consider while developing any framework.
     *
     * If we miss any above components that framework is not a complete framework.

    /**
     * What is test-data?
     *
     * In software testing test-data refers to set of inputs or conditions used to validate the functionality of software application.
     * Test-data is used to verify that the application behaves correctly under different scenarios and conditions, including normal and abnormal situations.
     *
     * Test-data can take different forms, depending on the type of testing being performed.
     * For example, in functional testing, test-data may include input values for various fields or test cases that simulate user interactions with the application.
     * In performance testing, test-data may include various types of load and stress scenarios, such as concurrent user requests or large data sets.
     *
     * Test-data is designed to ensure that software application is functioning as intended and to identify any defects or bugs that need to be fixed.
     * It is essential to use variety of test data that covers different use cases and scenarios, as this helps to ensure that the application is fully validated and can handle
     * different types of inputs and situations.
     *
     * In addition, we have to make sure that test-data is carefully created and managed to ensure that is accurate,relevant, and up-to-date.
     * This includes creating and maintaining test data sets, storing test data in a secure location, and ensuring that it is easily accessible to testers when needed.
     * Effective test data management can help to streamline the testing process and improve the overall quality of the software application.

    /**
     * What is Object repository?
     *
     * An object repository is a centralized location where the information related to the objects used in an application under test is stored.
     * It is essential part of testing framework as it allows testers to easily access and manipulate the application's objects during the testing process.
     *
     * In software testing object repository is typically used in automated testing frameworks to store the application's user interface elements such as
     * buttons,menus,text boxes, labels and other objects.
     *
     * By storing object information in a central repository, testers can quickly and easily access the objects during the testing process,without having to search for them
     * manually in the applications code.
     *
     * Object repositories are used to improve the efficiency and maintainability of automated test scripts.
     * Instead of hard coding object information in the test scripts, testers use object repository to store the information of the object's information,making it easy to
     * modify and reuse the objects across different test cases.
     *
     * This helps in reducing the maintenance effort required to update the test scripts whenever there are changes in the application's UI.

    /**
     * What is framework configuration in automation testing?
     *
     * Framework configuration in automation software testing refers to process of setting up and configuring the underlying testing framework that will be used to automate
     * the testing process.
     * It involves defining the structure of the automation framework,including the tools,technologies and best practices that will be used to create and execute the automated
     * test scripts.
     *
     * Framework configuration is essential step in automation testing because it helps to ensure that the automation process is efficient,reliable, and scalable.
     * It involves number of tasks, including:
     *
     * 1. Selecting the appropriate testing framework that meets the specific requirements of the project.
     *
     * 2. Setting up the development environment, including selecting the appropriate development tools, such as an integrated development environment(IDE), version control
     *    system and build management tool.
     *
     * 3. Defining the project-specific test automation architecture, including selecting appropriate test automation tools and libraries.
     *
     * 4. Creating the necessary tst data, including defining test scenarios, test cases, and expected results.
     *
     * 5. Configuring the automation framework to support the testing process, including defining test execution settings, such as the test environment, test data, and
     *    test execution parameters.
     *
     *    proper framework configuration is crucial to the success of any automation testing effort, as it helps to ensure that the automated test scripts are well-structured,
     *    maintainable, and scalable.
     *    It helps to ensure that testing process is efficient, reliable , and produces accurate results that can be used to improve the quality of the software being tested.
